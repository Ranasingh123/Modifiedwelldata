    "Average house size (The data was available only for the years after 2015. Though it is expected that an increase in the average house size would increase prices, it is found that the average home size has been consistently decreasing although the prica has been increasing)\n",
    "Land availability (Less land, higher prices. Perhaps this is why the prices has been rising even though the average house size has been decreasing. No relevant data could be found)\n",
    "Tax Rate (Too many brackets (7) and could not analyse due to time)\n",
